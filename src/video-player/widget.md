# Use the Azure Video Analyzer player widget

In this tutorial, you learn how to use a player widget within your application. This code is an easy-to-embed widget that allows your users to play video and browse through the portions of a segmented video file. To do this, you'll be generating a static HTML page with the widget embedded, and all the pieces to make it work.

In this tutorial, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a token
> * List videos
> * Get the base URL for playing back a [video application resource](./terminology.md#video)
> * Create a page with the player
> * Pass a streaming endpoint and a token to the player

## Prerequisites

The following are required for this tutorial:

* An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) if you don't already have one.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or another editor for the HTML file.
* Either [Continuous video recording and playback](./use-continuous-video-recording.md) or [Detect motion and record video on edge devices](./detect-motion-record-video-clips-cloud.md).

Additionally, it's helpful to be familiar with the following resources:

- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Create a token

In this section, you create a JSON Web Token (JWT) that you will use later in the article. You will use a sample application that will generate the JWT token and provide you with all the fields required to create the access policy.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you know how to generate a JWT token based on either an RSA or ECC certificate, you can skip this section.

1. Clone the [AVA C# samples repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/video-analyzer-iot-edge-csharp). Then, go to the *src/jwt-token-issuer* folder, and find the *JWTTokenIssuer* application.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > For more information about configuring your audience values, see [Access policies](./access-policies.md).

2. Open Visual Studio Code, and then go to the folder where you downloaded the *JWTTokenIssuer* application. This folder should contain the *\*.csproj* file.
3. In the explorer pane, go to the *program.cs* file.
4. On line 77, change the audience to your Azure Video Analyzer endpoint, followed by /videos/\*. It should look like the following:

   ```
   https://{Azure Video Analyzer Account ID}.api.{Azure Long Region Code}.videoanalyzer.azure.net/videos/*
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   > You can find the Video Analyzer endpoint in the overview section of the Video Analyzer resource in the Azure portal. This value is referenced as `clientApiEndpointUrl` in [List video resources](#list-video-resources), later in this article.

   :::image type="content" source="media/player-widget/client-api-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the player widget endpoint.":::
    
5. On line 78, change the issuer to the issuer value of your certificate (for example, `https://contoso.com`).
6. Save the file. You might be prompted with the message **Required assets to build and debug are missing from 'jwt token issuer'. Add them?** Select **Yes**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/player-widget/visual-studio-code-required-assets.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the required asset prompt in Visual Studio Code.":::
   
7. Open the Command Prompt window and go to the folder with the *JWTTokenIssuer* files. Run the following two commands: `dotnet build`, followed by `dotnet run`. If you have the C# extension on Visual Studio Code, you also can select F5 to run the *JWTTokenIssuer* application.

The application builds and runs. After it builds, it creates a self-signed certificate and generates the JWT token information from that certificate. You can also run the *JWTTokenIssuer.exe* file that's located in the debug folder of the directory where the *JWTTokenIssuer* built from. The advantage of running the application is that you can specify input options as follows:

- `JwtTokenIssuer [--audience=<audience>] [--issuer=<issuer>] [--expiration=<expiration>] [--certificatePath=<filepath> --certificatePassword=<password>]`

*JWTTokenIssuer* creates the JWT and the following required components:

- `Issuer`, `Audience`, `Key Type`, `Algorithm`, `Key Id`, `RSA Key Modulus`, `RSA Key Exponent`, `Token`

**Be sure to copy and save these values for later use.**

## Create an access policy

Access policies define the permissions and duration of access to a particular video stream. For this tutorial, configure an access policy for Video Analyzer in the Azure portal.  

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, and go to your resource group where your Video Analyzer account is located.
1. Select the Video Analyzer resource.
1. Under **Video Analyzer**, select **Access policies**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/player-widget/portal-access-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Access policies option.":::
   
1. Select **New**, and enter the following information:

   - **Access policy name**: You can choose any name.

   - **Issuer**: This value must match the JWT issuer. 

   - **Audience**: The audience for the JWT. `${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern}` is the default. To learn more about audience and `${System.Runtime.BaseResourceUrlPattern}`, see [Access policies](./access-policies.md).

   - **Key type**: RSA 

   - **Algorithm**: The supported values are RS256, RS384, and RS512.

   - **Key ID**: This ID is generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#create-a-token).

   - **RSA Key Modulus**: This value is generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#create-a-token).

   - **RSA Key Exponent**: This value is generated from your certificate. For more information, see [Create a token](#create-a-token).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/player-widget/access-policies-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the access policies portal."::: 
   
   > [!NOTE] 
   > These values come from the *JWTTokenIssuer* application created in the previous step.

1. Select **Save**.

## List video resources

Next, generate a list of video resources. You make a REST call to the account endpoint you used earlier, and you authenticate with the token you generated.

There are many ways to send a GET request to a REST API, but for this you're going to use a JavaScript function. The following code uses [XMLHttpRequest](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_xmlhttprequest_create.asp), coupled with values you're storing in the `clientApiEndpointUrl` and `token` fields on the page to send a synchronous `GET` request. It then takes the resulting list of videos and stores them in the `videoList` text area you have set up on the page.

```javascript
function getVideos()
{
    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var getUrl = document.getElementById("clientApiEndpointUrl").value + "/videos?api-version=2021-05-01-preview";
    xhttp.open("GET", getUrl, false);
    xhttp.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + document.getElementById("token").value);
    xhttp.send();
    document.getElementById("videoList").value = xhttp.responseText.toString();
}
```
   > [!NOTE]
   >The `clientApiEndPoint` and token are collected from [Create a token](#create-a-token).

## Add the Video Analyzer player component

Now that you have a client API endpoint URL, a token, and a video name, you can add the player to the page.

1. Include the player module itself by adding the package directly to your page. You can either include the NPM package direction in your application, or have it embed dynamically at runtime, as in the following:
   ```html
   <script async type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets"></script>
   ```
1. Add an `AVA-Player` element to the document:
   ```html
   <ava-player width="720px" id="avaPlayer"></ava-player>
   ```
1. Get a link to the Video Analyzer player widget that is in the page:
   ```javascript
   const avaPlayer = document.getElementById("avaPlayer");
   ```
1. To configure the player with the values that you have, you will need to set them up as an object, as shown here:
   ```javascript
   avaPlayer.configure( {
      token: document.getElementById("token").value,
      clientApiEndpointUrl: document.getElementById("clientApiEndpointUrl").value,
      videoName: document.getElementById("videoName").value
   } );
   ```
1. Load the video into the player to begin.
   ```javascript
   avaPlayer.load();
   ```

## Put it all together

Combining the preceding web elements, you get the following static HTML page. This page allows you to use an account endpoint and token to view a video.

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Video Analyzer Player Widget Demo</title>
</head>
<script async type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets"></script>
<body>
<script>
    function getVideos()
    {
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        var getUrl = document.getElementById("clientApiEndpointUrl").value + "/videos?api-version=2021-05-01-preview";
        xhttp.open("GET", getUrl, false);
        xhttp.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + document.getElementById("token").value);
        xhttp.send();
        document.getElementById("videoList").value = xhttp.responseText.toString();
    }
    function playVideo() {
        const avaPlayer = document.getElementById("avaPlayer");
        avaPlayer.configure( {
            token: document.getElementById("token").value,
            clientApiEndpointUrl: document.getElementById("clientApiEndpointUrl").value,
            videoName: document.getElementById("videoName").value
        } );
        avaPlayer.load();
    }
</script>
Client API endpoint URL: <input type="text" id="clientApiEndpointUrl" /><br><br>
Token: <input type="text" id="token" /><br><br>
<button type="submit" onclick="getVideos()">Get Videos</button><br><br>
<textarea rows="20" cols="100" id="videoList"></textarea><br><br>
Video name: <input type="text" id="videoName" /><br><br>
<button type="submit" onclick="playVideo()">Play Video</button><br><br>
<ava-player width="720px" id="avaPlayer"></ava-player>
</body>
</html>
```

## Host the page

You can test this page locally, but you might want to test a hosted version. In case you don't have a quick way to host a page, here are instructions on how to do so by using [static websites](../../storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website.md) with Azure Storage. The following steps are a condensed version of [these more complete instructions](../../storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to.md). The steps are updated for the files you're using in this tutorial.

1. Create a storage account.
1. Under **Data management**, select **Static website**.
1. Enable the static website on the storage account.
1. For **Index document name**, enter **index.html**.
1. For **Error document path**, enter **404.html**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Note the **Primary endpoint** that shows up. This will be your website.
1. Above **Primary endpoint**, select **$web**.
1. By using the **Upload** button at the top, upload your static HTML page as **index.html**.`

## Play a video

Now that you have the page hosted, go there and go through the steps to play a video.

1. Enter the **Client API endpoint URL** and **Token** values.
1. Select **Get videos**.
1. From the video list, select a video name, and enter it into the **Video name** field.
1. Select **Play video**.

## Additional details

The following sections contain some important additional details to be aware of.

### Refresh the access token

The player uses the access token that you generated earlier to get a playback authorization token. Tokens expire periodically and need to be refreshed. There are two ways to refresh the access token for the player after you've generated a new one:

* Actively calling the widget method `setAccessToken`.
    ```typescript
    avaPlayer.setAccessToken('<NEW-ACCESS-TOKEN>');
    ```
* Acting upon the `TOKEN_EXPIRED` event by listening to this event.
    ```typescript
    avaPlayer.addEventListener(PlayerEvents.TOKEN_EXPIRED, () => {
        avaPlayer.setAccessToken('<YOUR-NEW-TOKEN>');
    });
    ```

The `TOKEN_EXPIRED` event will occur 5 seconds before the token is going to expire. If you're setting an event listener, you should do so before calling the `load` function on the player widget.

### Configuration details

The preceding player has a simple configuration, but you can use a wider range of options for configuration values. The following are the supported fields:

| Name   | Type             | Description                         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `token`  | string | Your JWT token for the widget |
| `videoName` | string | The name of the video resource  |
| `clientApiEndpointUrl` | string | The endpoint URL for the client API |

### Alternate ways to load the code into your application

The package used to get the code into your application is an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets). In the preceding example, the latest version was loaded at runtime directly from the repository. But you can also download and install the package locally by using the following:

```bash
npm install @azure/video-analyzer/widgets
```

Or you can import it within your application code by using this for TypeScript:

```typescript
import { Player } from '@video-analyzer/widgets';
```

If you want to create a player widget dynamically, you can use this for JavaScript:
```javascript
<script async type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets@latest/dist/global.min.js"></script>
```

If you use this method to import, you will need to create the player object programmatically, after the import is complete. In the preceding example, you added the module to the page by using the `ava-player` HTML tag. To create a player object through code, you can do the following in JavaScript:

```javascript
const avaPlayer = new ava.widgets.player();
```

Or, in TypeScript:

```typescript
const avaPlayer = new Player();
```

Then you must add it to the HTML:

```javascript
document.firstElementChild.appendChild(avaPlayer);
```
### Using the AVA widget video player
The *AVA widget video player* is a ReactJS application that contains the following features:

### Video Player:
Enables you to view a video.

#### Adding the AVA Widget video player:

1. Include the AVA widget video player module itself by adding the package directly to your page:
    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets@latest/dist/global.min.js"></script>
    ```
1. Add an `AVA widget video player` element to the document:
    ```html
    <ava-player id="avaPlayer"></ava-player>
    ```
1. Get a reference to the `AVA widget video player` that is in the page using it's id:
    ```javascript
    const avaPlayer = document.getElementById("avaPlayer");
    ```
1. To configure the player with the values that you have, you will need to set them up as an object, as shown here:
   ```javascript
   avaPlayer.configure( {
      token: `token`,
      clientApiEndpointUrl: `clientApiEndpointUrl`,
      videoName: `videoName`
   } );
   ```
1. Load the video into the player to begin.
   ```javascript
   avaPlayer.load();
   ```


### Zone Drawer:
Enables you to create lines or polygons while viewing a video.

#### Adding the AVA Widget zone drawer:

1. Include the AVA widget module itself by adding the package directly to your page:
    ```html
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@azure/video-analyzer-widgets@latest/dist/global.min.js"></script>
    ```
1. Add an `AVA widget zone drawer` element to the document:
    ```html
    <div id="zonedrawer-container"></div>
    ```
1. Get a reference to the `AVA widget zone drawer` that is in the page:
    ```javascript
    const widgetContainer = document.querySelector("#zonedrawer-container");
    ```
1. To configure the zone drawer to set them up as an object, as shown below.

***Note:*** the zone drawer uses the video player to render the video so you can draw the zone on, so you'll need to configure the AVA widget video player as shown in the previous section.
   ```javascript
    // Get widget container
    const widgetContainer = document.querySelector("#zonedrawer-container");
    widgetContainer.innerHTML = '';
    const output = document.querySelector('#zone-output');
    output.value = '';
    setDisableCopy(true);
    // Create new zone drawer widget
    const zoneDrawer = new window.ava.widgets.zoneDrawer();
    widgetContainer.appendChild(zoneDrawer);
    // Create new player widget
    const playerWidget = new window.ava.widgets.player({
        token: `token`,
        clientApiEndpointUrl: `clientApiEndpointUrl`,
        videoName: `videoName`,
    });
    // Append the player widget to the zone drawer
    zoneDrawer.appendChild(playerWidget);
    // Load the player widget
    playerWidget.load();
    // Configure the zone drawer
    zoneDrawer.configure({
        locale: "en",
    });
   ```
1. Load the zone drawer to begin.
   ```javascript
    // Load the zone drawer widget
    zoneDrawer.load();
   ```
1. Additionally you can attach to the `ZONE_DRAWER_SAVE` event to get the coordinates of the drawn zone:
    ```javascript
    // Add 'save' event listener when user click save button
    zoneDrawer.addEventListener("ZONE_DRAWER_SAVE", (event) => {
    let currentOutput = '';
    for (const iterator of event?.detail) {
        currentOutput += JSON.stringify(iterator, null, 2);
    }
    const output = document.querySelector('#zone-output');
    output.value = currentOutput;
    handleOnChange(output.value);
    });
    ```

### Video Clips:
Enables you to create video clips by selecting a start and end time.

The `AVA widget video player` supports playing video clips by specifying a start and end date time as shown below:

***Note:*** the AVA widget video player uses UTC time standard, therefore the selected start and end time needs to be converted to this format.
```javascript
    const avaPlayer = document.getElementById("avaPlayer");
    const startUTCDate = new Date(Date.UTC(selectedClip.start.getFullYear(), selectedClip.start.getMonth(), selectedClip.start.getDate(), selectedClip.start.getHours(), selectedClip.start.getMinutes(), selectedClip.start.getSeconds()));
    const endUTCDate = new Date(Date.UTC(selectedClip.end.getFullYear(), selectedClip.end.getMonth(), selectedClip.end.getDate(), selectedClip.end.getHours(), selectedClip.end.getMinutes(), selectedClip.end.getSeconds()));
    avaPlayer.load({ startTime: startUTCDate, endTime: endUTCDate });
```
